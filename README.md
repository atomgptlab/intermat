# InterMat

## Introduction

Interface materials design (InterMat) package allows: 

 1) generation of an atomistic interface geometry,
 2) integrating multi-scale methods,
 3) determining interface properties such as equilibrium geometries, energetics, work functions, ionization potentials, electron affinities, band offsets, carrier effective masses, mobilities, and thermal conductivities,
 4) classification of heterojunction using various models such as ASJ, STJ and IU models,
 5) benchmarking calculated properties with experiments,
 6) training machine learning models especially for interface design.
